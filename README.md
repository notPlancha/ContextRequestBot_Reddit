This is the complete code for a code to send and recieve approvals for comments related to the post.
This program is presented "as-is", it's my first time working with threads and this isn't debugged so I reccomend to at least review the code before implementing in a big subreddit
Also the account needs to be a mod of said subreddit.
Also it's required to provide the info, such as client id and secret, subreddit and mod to such and the message to show the user
